<title>Liverpool Beats RCS Despite Injuries</title>
<content>
<p>An exciting game from the start, Liverpool's Sam Smith scored twice in the first five minutes, despite colliding with Bob Jones. With a critical knee injury, Smith was then replaced by Spanish-born new boy Diego. RCS started to rebound, just after the hour-mark, with Bob Jones rising higher than anyone in the penalty area to head home from a corner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Jones' luck didn't stay with him as, in the second half, Jones pulled up with a hamstring injury and had to be carried off on a stretcher. It looked the kind injury that won?t heal in short order. Replaced by Kenny Kent, RCS couldn't stop Liverpool as, twelve minutes from time, Diego made it 3-1.</p>
